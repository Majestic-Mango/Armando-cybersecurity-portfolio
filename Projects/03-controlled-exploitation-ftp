## Phase 1 – Host Discovery

An internal network scan identified a Linux host exposing multiple network
services. The system was selected as the primary assessment target based on
scope and accessibility within the internal network segment.

---

## Phase 2 – Service Enumeration

### Overview

Service and version enumeration revealed numerous legacy and insecure services,
including FTP, SMB, RPC, remote shell services, database services, and remote
desktop protocols. Several of these services are known to present high risk
when improperly configured or running outdated versions. Enumeration activities
were conducted in a non-intrusive manner without exploitation.

---

### FTP Enumeration (Port 21)

An FTP service was identified as exposed on the target host during service
enumeration. Further analysis was conducted to assess authentication
requirements and access controls.



#### Findings

The FTP service was identified as **vsFTPd version 2.3.4** and permitted
unauthenticated (anonymous) access. Unauthenticated users were able to
successfully log in and enumerate directory listings on the target system.

This configuration increases the risk of information disclosure and may provide
attackers with insight into system structure or sensitive data. Anonymous FTP
access may also be abused as a staging point for further attacks within an
internal network.

---

### NFS Enumeration (Port 2049)

An NFS service was identified as exposed on the target host. Enumeration was
performed to identify any exported directories accessible over the network.

#### Findings

Although the NFS service was running and accessible on port 2049, no exported
directories were listed during enumeration. This indicates that the service is
either restricted to specific hosts or not actively exporting filesystem paths.
While no immediate filesystem exposure was identified, the presence of an
unnecessary network service increases the overall attack surface.

---

## Phase 3 – Controlled Exploitation

Based on prior service enumeration, a known vulnerability affecting the FTP
service was selected for controlled exploitation. The objective was to validate
the real-world impact of the exposed service while maintaining strict scope
limitations.

---

### Exploit Selection

The target host was identified as running **vsFTPd version 2.3.4**, a version
known to contain a backdoored authentication mechanism that allows
unauthenticated remote command execution. This vulnerability was selected due
to explicit version confirmation during enumeration and the availability of
reliable public documentation.

---

### Exploitation Summary

An initial automated exploitation attempt using Metasploit was conducted but did
not result in an active session. Manual interaction was subsequently used to
trigger the backdoor condition, resulting in a remote command shell being
spawned on the target system.

Successful exploitation provided a shell with **root-level privileges**,
confirming the severity of the exposed FTP service and validating the attack
path identified during enumeration.

---

### Proof of Access

- User context: `root`
- Target host: `metasploitable`

---

### Scope Control

No further actions were taken following access verification. The session was
terminated immediately after confirming successful exploitation. No persistence,
lateral movement, privilege escalation, or system modification was performed.

This approach ensured that exploitation activities remained strictly within
defined scope boundaries and aligned with ethical penetration testing standards.
