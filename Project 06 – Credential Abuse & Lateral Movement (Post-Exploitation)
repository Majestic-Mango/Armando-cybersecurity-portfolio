## Phase 1 – Post-Exploitation Enumeration

Following controlled exploitation, post-exploitation enumeration was conducted
to establish context regarding the level of access obtained and the security
state of the compromised system.

Access was obtained under the `msfadmin` user account, providing authenticated
interactive shell access to the target host. Enumeration activities focused on
confirming user privileges, group memberships, operating system details, and
general system information relevant to assessing further risk.

This phase was limited to situational awareness and information gathering only.
No privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or system configuration changes
were performed during this stage.

## Phase 2 – Credential Exposure Assessment

Credential exposure checks were performed from an authenticated user context to
identify sensitive authentication material accessible post-compromise.

Assessment activities included review of shell command history, inspection of
readable configuration files, enumeration of SSH key material, and analysis of
scheduled task configurations. These locations are commonly associated with
credential leakage and privilege escalation opportunities.

No persistence mechanisms were deployed, and no system configurations were
modified during this phase.
