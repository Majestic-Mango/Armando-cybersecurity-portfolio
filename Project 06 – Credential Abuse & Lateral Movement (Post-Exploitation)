## Phase 1 – Post-Exploitation Enumeration

Following controlled exploitation, post-exploitation enumeration was conducted
to establish context regarding the level of access obtained and the security
state of the compromised system.

Access was obtained under the `msfadmin` user account, providing authenticated
interactive shell access to the target host. Enumeration activities focused on
confirming user privileges, group memberships, operating system details, and
general system information relevant to assessing further risk.

This phase was limited to situational awareness and information gathering only.
No privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or system configuration changes
were performed during this stage.

## Phase 2 – Credential Exposure Assessment

Credential exposure checks were performed from an authenticated user context to
identify sensitive authentication material accessible post-compromise.

Assessment activities included review of shell command history, inspection of
readable configuration files, enumeration of SSH key material, and analysis of
scheduled task configurations. These locations are commonly associated with
credential leakage and privilege escalation opportunities.

No persistence mechanisms were deployed, and no system configurations were
modified during this phase.

## Phase 4 – Security Impact Summary

This project demonstrated how authenticated access obtained through a controlled
exploitation could be leveraged to assess post-compromise risk without exceeding
ethical or operational scope.

Post-exploitation activities confirmed that even non-root access provides
valuable insight into system configuration, user context, and potential trust
relationships. Enumeration of users, services, and system details highlighted
conditions that could enable credential exposure or lateral movement in a
broader network environment if defensive controls are insufficient.

Although no privilege escalation or lateral movement was performed, the analysis
illustrates how initial access can significantly increase organizational risk.
These findings emphasize the importance of enforcing least-privilege access,
protecting credentials, and monitoring post-authentication behavior to reduce
attacker dwell time and prevent escalation.
