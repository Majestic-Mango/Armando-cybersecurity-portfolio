## Phase 1 – Identified Risks

Previous assessment activities identified multiple insecure and legacy service
configurations that significantly increased the attack surface of the target
system.

Key risks included:
- Anonymous access permitted on FTP services
- Outdated and vulnerable FTP service (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
- Anonymous SMB access exposing internal shares
- Unnecessary network services increasing overall exposure
- Lack of service-level access controls and authentication enforcement

These weaknesses collectively enabled unauthorized access and, in one case,
direct remote command execution with root-level privileges.

## Phase 2 – Mitigation Strategy

Mitigation efforts were designed to directly address the risks identified during
reconnaissance and controlled exploitation activities. The primary objective was
to reduce attack surface, eliminate unauthenticated access paths, and align
system configuration with industry-recognized security best practices.

Mitigation priorities were established using a risk-based approach, focusing on
services that permitted unauthenticated access or enabled remote command
execution. Controls were selected to provide immediate risk reduction while
remaining feasible within an enterprise environment.

The following mitigation principles guided remediation efforts:
- Disable or remove unnecessary and legacy services
- Enforce strong authentication and access controls
- Restrict network exposure through service hardening and firewall rules
- Align remediation actions with CIS Benchmarks and the NIST Cybersecurity
  Framework (CSF)

Mitigation actions were categorized into service-level hardening, network-level
controls, and administrative safeguards to ensure layered defense.

## Phase 3 – Secure Configuration & Hardening

Following risk assessment and mitigation planning, secure configuration changes
were identified to reduce the exposed attack surface and prevent recurrence of
the identified vulnerabilities. No remediation actions were executed on the
target system; this phase documents recommended controls consistent with
enterprise security practices.

### FTP Hardening (vsFTPd – Port 21)

The FTP service was identified as a critical risk due to anonymous access and
a known remote command execution vulnerability in vsFTPd version 2.3.4.

#### Recommended Controls
- Disable FTP entirely if not operationally required
- Replace FTP with secure alternatives such as SFTP or SCP
- Enforce authenticated access and disable anonymous login
- Restrict service access via host-based firewall rules
- Ensure services are patched and maintained at supported versions

#### Risk Reduction
These controls eliminate unauthenticated access paths and remove a known
exploitable service, significantly reducing the likelihood of remote compromise.

---

### SMB Hardening (Ports 139 / 445)

SMB services permitted anonymous authentication and exposed multiple network
shares, increasing the risk of information disclosure and lateral movement.

#### Recommended Controls
- Disable SMB if not required
- Enforce authentication and disable anonymous access
- Restrict share permissions using least-privilege principles
- Limit SMB access to trusted subnets only
- Upgrade legacy SMB implementations where applicable

#### Risk Reduction
Restricting SMB access prevents unauthenticated enumeration and reduces
exposure to credential harvesting and internal movement techniques.

---

### NFS Hardening (Port 2049)

Although no exported directories were identified, the presence of an exposed
NFS service increased overall attack surface.

#### Recommended Controls
- Disable NFS if unused
- Restrict exports to specific hosts using explicit access control
- Apply read-only permissions where possible
- Enforce firewall restrictions at the network layer

#### Risk Reduction
Removing or restricting NFS minimizes the risk of future filesystem exposure
and unauthorized access if configuration changes occur.

---

### Network-Level Controls

Multiple services were accessible across the internal network without
segmentation or filtering.

#### Recommended Controls
- Implement host-based firewall rules to limit inbound services
- Restrict administrative services to management networks
- Monitor exposed services using intrusion detection or logging mechanisms

#### Risk Reduction
Network controls reduce attacker visibility and limit opportunities for service
discovery and exploitation.

---

### Administrative Safeguards

The system exhibited characteristics consistent with default or intentionally
vulnerable configurations.

#### Recommended Controls
- Maintain accurate service inventories
- Disable legacy or test services prior to production deployment
- Perform routine vulnerability scanning and configuration audits
- Apply security baselines such as CIS Benchmarks

#### Risk Reduction
Administrative controls ensure sustained security posture and prevent insecure
configurations from persisting over time.

## Defensive Outcome Summary

If implemented, the recommended hardening measures would significantly reduce
the system’s attack surface by removing unauthenticated access paths, eliminating
legacy services, and enforcing least-privilege access controls.

These actions align with defense-in-depth principles and demonstrate how
enumeration and exploitation findings can be translated into actionable,
enterprise-relevant security improvements.
