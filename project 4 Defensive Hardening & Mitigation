## Phase 1 – Identified Risks

Previous assessment activities identified multiple insecure and legacy service
configurations that significantly increased the attack surface of the target
system.

Key risks included:
- Anonymous access permitted on FTP services
- Outdated and vulnerable FTP service (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
- Anonymous SMB access exposing internal shares
- Unnecessary network services increasing overall exposure
- Lack of service-level access controls and authentication enforcement

These weaknesses collectively enabled unauthorized access and, in one case,
direct remote command execution with root-level privileges.

## Phase 2 – Mitigation Strategy

Mitigation efforts were designed to directly address the risks identified during
reconnaissance and controlled exploitation activities. The primary objective was
to reduce attack surface, eliminate unauthenticated access paths, and align
system configuration with industry-recognized security best practices.

Mitigation priorities were established using a risk-based approach, focusing on
services that permitted unauthenticated access or enabled remote command
execution. Controls were selected to provide immediate risk reduction while
remaining feasible within an enterprise environment.

The following mitigation principles guided remediation efforts:
- Disable or remove unnecessary and legacy services
- Enforce strong authentication and access controls
- Restrict network exposure through service hardening and firewall rules
- Align remediation actions with CIS Benchmarks and the NIST Cybersecurity
  Framework (CSF)

Mitigation actions were categorized into service-level hardening, network-level
controls, and administrative safeguards to ensure layered defense.
