## Phase 1 – Identified Risks

Previous assessment activities identified multiple insecure and legacy service
configurations that significantly increased the attack surface of the target
system.

Key risks included:
- Anonymous access permitted on FTP services
- Outdated and vulnerable FTP service (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
- Anonymous SMB access exposing internal shares
- Unnecessary network services increasing overall exposure
- Lack of service-level access controls and authentication enforcement

These weaknesses collectively enabled unauthorized access and, in one case,
direct remote command execution with root-level privileges.
