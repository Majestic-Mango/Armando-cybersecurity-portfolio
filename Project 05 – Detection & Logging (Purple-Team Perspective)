## Phase 1 – Observable Attacker Activity

During prior assessment activities, several actions were performed that would
generate detectable artifacts within host and network logs. These actions
included network reconnaissance, service enumeration, and a controlled
exploitation of a vulnerable FTP service.

Observable attacker behaviors included:
- Network scanning and service discovery
- Anonymous authentication attempts against SMB and FTP services
- Manual interaction with an FTP service to trigger a known backdoor condition
- Remote command execution resulting in a root-level shell

These activities represent common attacker behaviors that defenders can
monitor for using standard logging and monitoring controls.

## Phase 2 – Host-Based Detection Opportunities

Host-based logging provides critical visibility into authentication events,
service interactions, and process execution occurring on the target system.
The activities performed during reconnaissance and exploitation would generate
multiple detectable artifacts at the operating system and application level.

### Authentication & Service Logs

Anonymous authentication attempts against FTP and SMB services would be recorded
within service-specific and system authentication logs. These events may include
failed or unusual login attempts, anonymous session creation, and service
connection metadata.

Relevant log sources include:
- FTP service logs (vsFTPd authentication and session logs)
- System authentication logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`)
- SMB authentication and access logs

Repeated anonymous access or authentication attempts originating from a single
host would represent a strong indicator of reconnaissance or unauthorized access
activity.

---

### Process Execution & Privilege Events

The successful exploitation of the FTP service resulted in remote command
execution with root-level privileges. This activity would generate host-level
artifacts related to unexpected process creation and privilege context changes.

Relevant indicators include:
- Unexpected shell processes spawned by network-facing services
- Commands executed under elevated (root) privileges
- Process trees originating from FTP service contexts

Host-based monitoring solutions could detect these anomalies by correlating
process execution with service activity.

---

### File System & Configuration Monitoring

Although no persistence or file modification was performed during exploitation,
file integrity monitoring could detect unauthorized changes if an attacker
attempted to modify system files, binaries, or configuration data following
initial access.

Monitoring sensitive directories and configuration files would provide early
warning of post-exploitation activity.

---

### Defensive Value

Host-based detection enables defenders to identify suspicious authentication
patterns, abnormal process execution, and privilege escalation events. When
combined with proper alerting, these controls can significantly reduce attacker
dwell time and support rapid incident response.

## Phase 3 – Network-Based Detection Opportunities

Network-based monitoring provides visibility into traffic patterns, service
exposure, and anomalous connections that may indicate reconnaissance or active
exploitation. The activities performed during enumeration and controlled
exploitation would generate multiple observable network indicators.

---

### Network Reconnaissance & Scanning Activity

Initial reconnaissance involved active scanning and service enumeration across
the internal network. These actions would produce identifiable network patterns,
including sequential port scanning and repeated connection attempts across
multiple services.

Relevant detection opportunities include:
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) flagging port scans or service probes
- NetFlow or traffic analysis showing abnormal connection frequency
- Firewall logs indicating repeated connection attempts from a single source

Such activity often represents early-stage attacker behavior and can be used as
a trigger for further investigation.

---

### Service Interaction & Authentication Traffic

Enumeration and exploitation of FTP and SMB services would generate observable
traffic at the network layer, including anonymous authentication attempts and
unexpected protocol usage.

Indicators may include:
- FTP login attempts using anonymous or malformed credentials
- SMB connections without authentication
- Repeated connections to legacy or high-risk services

Network monitoring tools can identify these behaviors by correlating protocol
usage with expected baselines.

---

### Backdoor Port & Anomalous Connections

The vsFTPd backdoor exploitation resulted in the spawning of a shell listening
on an atypical port (TCP 6200). Any inbound connection to this port would
represent a strong indicator of compromise.

Relevant detection opportunities include:
- Firewall or IDS alerts for connections to non-standard or unexpected ports
- Network traffic originating from FTP services to high-numbered ports
- Unusual session behavior inconsistent with normal service operation

Detection of such anomalous connections could enable rapid identification of
active exploitation.

---

### Defensive Value

Network-based detection complements host-based logging by providing early
visibility into scanning activity, unauthorized service interactions, and
unexpected network connections. When combined with host-level telemetry, these
controls enable defenders to identify attacks earlier in the kill chain and
reduce overall impact.

## Phase 4 – Detection Summary & Defensive Value

This project demonstrated how attacker behaviors observed during reconnaissance,
enumeration, and controlled exploitation can be detected using standard host-based
and network-based monitoring controls.

Host-level telemetry provides visibility into suspicious authentication events,
unexpected process execution, and privilege escalation attempts. Network-level
monitoring complements this by identifying scanning activity, anomalous service
interactions, and connections to non-standard ports indicative of active
exploitation.

The combination of host-based and network-based detection enables defenders to
identify malicious activity at multiple stages of the attack lifecycle, from
initial discovery through exploitation. Early detection of reconnaissance
activity provides an opportunity to intervene before compromise occurs, while
monitoring for exploitation artifacts enables rapid incident response when
preventive controls fail.

Collectively, these detection strategies demonstrate how offensive techniques
can be leveraged to improve defensive visibility. By understanding how attacks
manifest in logs and network traffic, security teams can enhance monitoring,
reduce attacker dwell time, and strengthen overall security posture.
