## Phase 1 – Host Discovery & Enumeration

An internal network scan identified a Linux host exposing multiple network
services. A targeted service and version enumeration scan was conducted to
identify potential attack surface.

### Key Findings
The target system exposes numerous legacy and insecure services, including FTP,
SMB, RPC, remote shell services, database services, and remote desktop protocols.
Several of these services are known to be high-risk when improperly configured
or running outdated versions.
